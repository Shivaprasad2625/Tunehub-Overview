I have created a full-stack web application called TuneHub, aimed at providing users with a comprehensive music streaming experience. The application incorporates various features including user authentication, music exploration, playlist creation, premium membership, and seamless payment integration.

Frontend Development:

In the frontend, I have worked on designing and implementing the user interface using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces. I have created different components for handling user authentication, registration, playlist management, and song exploration. These components utilize React Router for navigation and Axios for making HTTP requests to the backend server.

Backend Development:

On the backend side, I have utilized Spring Boot, a Java-based framework, to build RESTful APIs for handling various functionalities of the application. The backend controllers, such as NavController, PaymentController, PlaylistController, SongController, and UserController, are responsible for managing routes and processing requests from the frontend. These controllers interact with the service layer, which contains business logic for user management, playlist management, song management, and payment processing.

Database Integration:

The application utilizes a relational database (not shown in the provided code snippets) to store user information, songs, playlists, and payment-related data. I have integrated the backend with the database using Spring Data JPA, which provides an abstraction layer for working with databases in a Spring application. The database schema is designed to efficiently store and retrieve data related to users, songs, playlists, and payment transactions.

Payment Integration:

TuneHub supports premium memberships, allowing users to access exclusive features and content. For handling premium membership subscriptions, I have integrated the application with Razorpay, a payment gateway, to facilitate secure and seamless online transactions. The PaymentController handles the creation of payment orders and verifies payment signatures to ensure the integrity of payment transactions.

User Authentication and Authorization:

The application features user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to user accounts and resources. Users can register, log in, and log out of their accounts using email and password credentials. The UserController validates user credentials and assigns appropriate roles (admin or customer) based on user privileges. Authorized users can access premium content and features available in the application.

Future Enhancements:

As part of ongoing development efforts, future enhancements to TuneHub may include additional features such as social media integration, personalized recommendations, collaborative playlists, offline mode, and support for multiple languages. These enhancements aim to further enhance the user experience and expand the capabilities of the application in catering to diverse user needs and preferences.
