Purpose: The login module serves as the gateway for users to access their accounts within the TuneHub application.

Functionality: Users input their email and password credentials into designated fields. The email field ensures a valid email format, while the password field conceals characters for security.

Submission: Upon completing the form, users click the "LOGIN" button to submit their credentials.

Authentication: Form data is securely transmitted to the backend's "/validate" endpoint, where authentication occurs. If the credentials are valid, users are granted access to their accounts; otherwise, they are prompted to re-enter their information.

Visual Presentation: The form's appearance is visually enhanced using an external CSS stylesheet, improving user experience and aesthetics.

In summary, the login module facilitates secure access to user accounts by collecting and validating credentials before granting access to the application's features and functionalities.
